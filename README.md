# Nietzsche's "Will to Power"

Friedrich Nietzsche's late notebooks contain an outline of 374 texts to be included in a work to be called "The Will to Power." While he did not live to complete that work, the texts that he earmarked for inclusion are still extant in his notebook material.

However, the outline is incomplete. While it assigns most of the texts to one of four divisions in a corresponding table of contents, it does not tell us which subdivisions they belong in, or what order they should appear in.

This project is a web app that will allow scholars and other interested parties to work on arrangements of these texts, in order to see how they might have come together as a book. The backend is written using Ruby on Rails to manage the texts and user-created "editions," while the frontend will be written using Vue, to allow users to elegantly rearrange texts and move them between divisions by dragging and dropping. Hopefully this tool will help us to arrive at some interesting and enlightening insights into Nietzsche's late thought.
